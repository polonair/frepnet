1) Program is not outputting Query 11 and Query 12.

2) A FundID can belong to multiple categories (But its fundName, FundLaunchDate will be same always).
Currently the program is giving error if a FundID is listed in multiple categories, Showing error like "Fund ID 'ZBA5HJ8909' duplicated at line no.583".
So in simple words, allow duplicate fundID in standard file if its fundName, FundLaunchDate are same across the duplications. 
But don't allow duplications in dynamic file. In dynamic file all fundID's are unique and appear only one time.

4) {{fundLaunchDate}}. (Print format: 1st July 2017). So is it possible to print in such format? (And don't print time, print just date).

5) Decimal Points: some values are too much lengthy after decimal point like 0.426542288557214 and not good to look.
navChange% : Just output as 15%, 22%, 4%, 9%.....in such style. If not possible, limit value to 2 decimal points.
performanceScore, performanceImprovementScore: Limit value to 2 decimal points. For example, instead of 0.426542288557214, please print it as  0.43

6) Query 1 & Query 2: I expected Reverse order.
You currently followed {{todayNAV}}-{{yesterdayNAV}} format.
Okay, Continue following that formula. But, Please reverse the current sorting order.
But don't print the negative sign (-) infront of {{navChange}} & {{navChange%}} values.
My concept is to show the Mutual Fund that largely lost value on the top.
APPLICABLE FOR EVERY QUERY: "If {{navChange}} & {{navChange%}} values are positive, print their value as "0" instead of their real value".

7) Query 3: PerformanceScoreRank is given in reverse order.

8) Query 4: PerformanceImprovementScoreRank is given in reverse order.

9) Query 5: Highest rating Rank is given in reverse order.

10) Query 6: Working correctly.

11) Query 7: Depends on other queries, so giving incorrect results. But sorting/ranking is correct.

Query 8,9 are working perfectly.

Query10 is just a copy of query4.

And also please apply the Above mentioned fixes for Query11- Query20 as well.
