Query 3) sorted by performanceScoreRank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3...)
Query 4) sorted by performanceScoreImprovement% Rank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3....)
Query 5) sorted by highestRatingRank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3....)
Query 6) sorted by daysSinceLaunch (lowest number to highest number)
Query 7) sorted by overallScore rank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3...)
Query 8) sorted by todayNAV (highest to lowest)
Query 9) sorted by todayNAV (lowest to highest)
Query 10) sorted by performanceScoreImprovement% Rank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3....) [This query is exactly same as query 4. Just a copy].
