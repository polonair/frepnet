-------------------------------CSV file default values & optional fields----------------------------------------------

Standard File:

	ID: Must
	Fund name: Must
	Category: Must
	Launch Date: Must
	Note 1 - 7: Optional. Default is blank.
	Include in Query Columns: Optional. Default is "NO". Unless specified as "YES". If the value is blank/anything other than YES, then consider it as NO.


Date Wise File:

	ID: Must.
	NAV: Optional. Default is blank. Value should be blank or number.
	Value research rating: Default is blank. Value should be blank or number.
	Total bond sales: Default is blank. Value should be blank or number.


In the standard file: If any of the fields specified as 'must' is missing, then reject uploading that fund ID. But upload other fund id's from the file.

In the Date wise file: 

	> Case1: Fund ID is missing in date wise file, but present in standard file. In this case, consider nav, rating, sales of that fund ID as BLANK for that date.

	> Case2: Fund ID not present in standard file, but present in date wise file. In this case, don't upload that Fund ID. Upload remaining Fund ID's.



------------------------------Queries---------------------------------------------

1) Regarding NAV Change queries (1, 2, 11, 12):

Today NAV is compulsory. If not available, then don't consider that fund id in these NAV change queries.
Yesterday NAV: If available, use yesterday NAV. If yesterday NAV is not available, then use "Last 10 days average NAV from Day3:Day12" value. 

for queries: 11, 12

Today NAV is compulsory. If not available, then don't consider that fund id in these NAV change queries.
$previousNAV (20 days before date NAV): If available, use $previousNAV. If not use "Last 10 days average NAV from Day21:Day31" value.

If some NAV values are not available between Day3:Day12 and Day21:Day31, then calculate average only for available values. 

If NAV values are not available for all dates in last 10 days, then don't consider that Fund ID in that query.


2) For all other queries:

If Today NAV or Today Value research rating or Today Bond sales values are not available, then
> Use last 10 days average of these values.

If Last 10 days average also not available for all 3 fields (nav, value research rating, total bond sales), then don't consider that fund id in queries.
> If atleast one of these 3 fields Today Values or Last 10 days average value is available, Then consider that fund id in queries.
