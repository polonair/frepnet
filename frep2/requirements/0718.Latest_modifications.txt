1) Morning we already discussed about Nav queries, now regarding non-nav change queries (all queries except Query1,2,11,12):

If Today NAV = Not available......Do the same as I explained in the morning. Use replacementNAV. Same process as I explained in the morning.
Yesterday NAV and nav of other dates is not much important for these queries.

If Today VRR, TBS is not available....Do the same as I explained in the morning in sketch.

NOTE: Only difference between NAV queries (Query 1,2,11,12) and Non-NAV queries:
If today nav is not available, fund ignored in nav queries. In non-nav queries fund is considered even if today nav is not available by using replacement nav.

>> I forgot to add this point in the text file in point1:
>> "If today nav and replacement nav, both are not available. Then ignore that fund in query".


2) If a FundID is ignored in any one of these ranks: performanceScoreRank, performanceImprovement%Rank, highestRatingRank
Then also ignore it in overallScoreRank queries (Query 7, Query 17)
Because overallrank depends on other ranks, so without other ranks it gives incorrect overallScoreRank.



3) Everywhere in the output results, please output NAV in the format: Rs 290. I mean add "Rs" before the NAV output value. 
If NAV is not available (even after searching other dates as I explained in the morning), then output as NA.

For example,
Rs 1112
NA

Currently we are simply outputting number only, like:
1112


4) One optional feature:

Let me know if a feature like this is possible. Ignoring fundID's from queries that don't meet certain conditions. It was same like specifying NO in standard.csv

Query 1: Ignore if NAV > 100, Ignore if VRR > 2, Ignore if TBS > 10. Ignore if any one is true. Specify as # if you have no rules.
Query 2: Ignore if NAV > #, Ignore if VRR > #, Ignore if TBS > # 
Query 3: Ignore if NAV > #, Ignore if VRR > #, Ignore if TBS > #
Query 4: Ignore if NAV > #, Ignore if VRR > #, Ignore if TBS > #
Query 5: Ignore if NAV > #, Ignore if VRR > #, Ignore if TBS > #
.....and so on.

If possible, I can upload a text file with this info or mention it somewhere that you specify.
