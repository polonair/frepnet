Formula's:

Performance score = (value research rating * total bond sales) / No.of days since launch
Performance score improvement % = compare todays performance score to 20 days back performance score of that fund (represent in percentage).
Overall score = performance score rank number + performance improvement % rank number + highest rating rank number


Queries:

Query 1) sorted by navChange% (highest to lowest)
Query 2) sorted by navChangeLong% (highest to lowest)
Query 3) sorted by performanceScoreRank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3...)
Query 4) sorted by performanceScoreImprovement% Rank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3....)
Query 5) sorted by highestRatingRank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3....)
Query 6) sorted by daysSinceLaunch (lowest number to highest number)
Query 7) sorted by overallScore rank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3...)
Query 8) sorted by todayNAV (highest to lowest)
Query 9) sorted by todayNAV (lowest to highest)
Query 10) sorted by performanceScoreImprovement% Rank (Rank 1, rank 2, rank 3....) [This query is exactly same as query 4. Just a copy].


Query 11 - 20: Are same as query 1 - 10. The difference being 1 - 10 calculate & output results within category. Query 11 - 20 are irrespective of categories (They calculate among all categories).



--------------------------------Html printing--------------------------------------------

1) Print only 50 results per html page. Then print remaining in next pages.

2) Just print 3 pages, no need to print all pages. I mean just print 3 pages as output for each category. For queries 11 - 20, just print 3 pages per query.

3) For NAV queries (1, 2, 11, 12): Output only if NAV Change value is positive. Don't output "0" nav change or negative nav change fund id's in the output results.
